Converts supplied data to a `DateTensor` if possible.

```python
tf_quant_finance.datetime.convert_to_date_tensor(
    date_inputs
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Args:


* <b>`date_inputs`</b>: One of the supported types that can be converted to a
  DateTensor. The following input formats are supported. 1. Sequence of
  `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.date`, or any other structure with data
  attributes called 'year', 'month' and 'day'. 2. A numpy array of
  `datetime64` type. 3. Sequence of (year, month, day) Tuples. Months are
  1-based (with January as 1) and constants.Months enum may be used instead
  of ints. Days are also 1-based. 4. A tuple of three int32 `Tensor`s
  containing year, month and date as positive integers in that order. 5. A
  single int32 `Tensor` containing ordinals (i.e. number of days since 31
  Dec 0 with 1 being 1 Jan 1.)


#### Returns:

A `DateTensor` object representing the supplied dates.



#### Raises:


* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If conversion fails for any reason.
