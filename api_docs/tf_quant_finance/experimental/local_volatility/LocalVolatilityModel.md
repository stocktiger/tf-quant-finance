Local volatility model for smile modeling.

Inherits From: [`GenericItoProcess`](../../../tf_quant_finance/models/GenericItoProcess.md)

```python
tf_quant_finance.experimental.local_volatility.LocalVolatilityModel(
    dim, risk_free_rate=None, dividend_yield=None, local_volatility_fn=None,
    corr_matrix=None, times_grid=None, spot_grid=None, precompute_iv=False,
    dtype=None, name=None
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Local volatility (LV) model specifies that the dynamics of an asset is
governed by the following stochastic differential equation:

```None
  dS(t) / S(t) =  mu(t, S(t)) dt + sigma(t, S(t)) * dW(t)
```
where `mu(t, S(t))` is the drift and `sigma(t, S(t))` is the instantaneous
volatility. The local volatility function `sigma(t, S(t))` is state dependent
and is computed by calibrating against a given implied volatility surface
`sigma_iv(T, K)` using the Dupire's formula [1]:

```
sigma(T,K)^2 = 2 * (dC(T,K)/dT + (r - q)K dC(T,K)/dK + qC(T,K)) /
                   (K^2 d2C(T,K)/dK2)
```
where the derivatives above are the partial derivatives. The LV model provides
a flexible framework to model any (arbitrage free) volatility surface.

#### Example: Simulation of local volatility process.

import numpy as np
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tf_quant_finance as tff

dtype = tf.float64
dim = 2
year = dim * [[2021, 2022]]
month = dim * [[1, 1]]
day = dim * [[1, 1]]
expiries = tff.datetime.dates_from_year_month_day(year, month, day)
valuation_date = [(2020, 1, 1)]
expiry_times = tff.datetime.daycount_actual_365_fixed(
    start_date=valuation_date, end_date=expiries, dtype=dtype)
strikes = dim * [[[0.1, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 3], [0.1, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 3]]]
iv = dim * [[[0.135, 0.13, 0.1, 0.11, 0.13],
             [0.135, 0.13, 0.1, 0.11, 0.13]]]
spot = dim * [1.0]
risk_free_rate = [0.02]
r = tf.convert_to_tensor(risk_free_rate, dtype=dtype)
df = lambda t: tf.math.exp(-r * t)

lv = tff.models.LocalVolatilityModel.from_market_data(
    dim, val_date, expiries, strikes, iv, spot, df, [0.0], dtype=dtype)
num_samples = 10000

    [1.0, 1.5, 2.0],

## Methods

<h3 id="dim"><code>dim</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
dim()
```

The dimension of the process.


<h3 id="drift_fn"><code>drift_fn</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
drift_fn()
```

Python callable calculating instantaneous drift.

The callable should accept two real `Tensor` arguments of the same dtype.
The first argument is the scalar time t, the second argument is the value of
Ito process X - `Tensor` of shape
`batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim]`, where `batch_shape` represents a batch
of models and `sample_shape` represents samples for each of the models. The
result is value of drift a(t, X). The return value of the callable is a real
`Tensor` of the same dtype as the input arguments and of shape
`batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim]`. For example, `sample_shape` can stand
for `[num_samples]` for Monte Carlo sampling, or
`[num_grid_points_1, ..., num_grid_points_dim]` for Finite Difference
solvers.

#### Returns:

The instantaneous drift rate callable.


<h3 id="dtype"><code>dtype</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
dtype()
```

The data type of process realizations.


<h3 id="fd_solver_backward"><code>fd_solver_backward</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
fd_solver_backward(
    start_time, end_time, coord_grid, values_grid, discounting=None,
    one_step_fn=None, boundary_conditions=None, start_step_count=0, num_steps=None,
    time_step=None, values_transform_fn=None, dtype=None, name=None, **kwargs
)
```

Returns a solver for Feynman-Kac PDE associated to the process.

This method applies a finite difference method to solve the final value
problem as it appears in the Feynman-Kac formula associated to this Ito
process. The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov
equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion
of a discounting function.

For more details of the Feynman-Kac theorem see [1]. The PDE solved by this
method is:

```None
  V_t + Sum[mu_i(t, x) V_i, 1<=i<=n] +
    (1/2) Sum[ D_{ij} V_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] - r(t, x) V = 0
```

In the above, `V_t` is the derivative of `V` with respect to `t`,
`V_i` is the partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `V_{ij}` the
(mixed) partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `x_j`. `mu_i` is the
drift of this process and `D_{ij}` are the components of the diffusion
tensor:

```None
  D_{ij}(t,x) = (Sigma(t,x) . Transpose[Sigma(t,x)])_{ij}
```

This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).
The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional
rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described
by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,
a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian
product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with
coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.

This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means
the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
(e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified
by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a
`Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th
axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:
`batch_shape + payoff_shape + [d1, d2, ... dn]` where `batch_shape` is the
batch of processes as in the underlying `drift_fn` and `volatility_fn` and
`payoff_shape` are the equations to be solved for each batch element.

The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
(sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time
step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of
steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the
`time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need
discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument
may not be applicable to some implementations.

The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used
methods, see functions in <a href="../../../tf_quant_finance/math/pde/steppers.md"><code>math.pde.steppers</code></a> module.

The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above
equation are described in the Args section below.

For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see

#### Args:


* <b>`start_time`</b>: Real positive scalar `Tensor`. The start time of the grid.
  Corresponds to time `t0` above.
* <b>`end_time`</b>: Real scalar `Tensor` smaller than the `start_time` and greater
  than zero. The time to step back to. Corresponds to time `t1` above.
* <b>`coord_grid`</b>: List of `n` rank 1 real `Tensor`s. `n` is the dimension of the
  domain. The i-th `Tensor` has shape, `[d_i]` where `d_i` is the size of
  the grid along axis `i`. The coordinates of the grid points. Corresponds
  to the spatial grid `G` above.
* <b>`values_grid`</b>: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
  `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape
  of the `Tensor` must broadcast with
  `batch_shape + payoff_shape + [d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. `batch_shape`
  represents the batch of the processes as in the underlying `drift_fn`
  and `volatility_fn`. `payoff_shape` specifies equations to be solved for
  each batch element (with potentially different boundary/final conditions
  and for various coordinate grids). When the batch dimensions
  `batch_shape` or `payoff_shape` are present, the shape of values_grid`
  must be at least `batch_shape + payoff_shape + dim * [1]`.
* <b>`discounting`</b>: Callable corresponding to `r(t,x)` above. If not supplied,
  zero discounting is assumed.
* <b>`one_step_fn`</b>: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following
  arguments by keyword:
    1. 'time': Current time
    2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time
      evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.
    3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.
    4. 'values_grid': The values grid.
    5. 'boundary_conditions': The boundary conditions.
    6. 'quadratic_coeff': A callable returning the quadratic coefficients
      of the PDE (i.e. `(1/2)D_{ij}(t, x)` above). The callable accepts
      the time and  coordinate grid as keyword arguments and returns a
      `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts with `[dim, dim]`.
    7. 'linear_coeff': A callable returning the linear coefficients of the
      PDE (i.e. `mu_i(t, x)` above). Accepts time and coordinate grid as
      keyword arguments and returns a `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts
      with `[dim]`.
    8. 'constant_coeff': A callable returning the coefficient of the
      linear homogeneous term (i.e. `r(t,x)` above). Same spec as above.
      The `one_step_fn` callable returns a 2-tuple containing the next
      coordinate grid, next values grid.
* <b>`boundary_conditions`</b>: The boundary conditions. Only rectangular boundary
  conditions are supported. A list of tuples of size `n` (space dimension
  of the PDE). The elements of the Tuple can be either a Python Callable
  or `None` representing the boundary conditions at the minimum and
  maximum values of the spatial variable indexed by the position in the
  list. E.g., for `n=2`, the length of `boundary_conditions` should be 2,
  `boundary_conditions[0][0]` describes the boundary `(y_min, x)`, and
  `boundary_conditions[1][0]`- the boundary `(y, x_min)`. `None` values
  mean that the second order terms for that dimension on the boundary are
  assumed to be zero, i.e., if `boundary_conditions[k][0]` is `None`,
  'dV/dt + Sum[a_ij d2(A_ij V)/dx_i dx_j, 1 <= i, j <= n, i!=k+1, j!=k+1]
     + Sum[b_i d(B_i V)/dx_i, 1 <= i <= n] + c V = 0.'
  For not `None` values, the boundary conditions are accepted in the form
  `alpha(t, x) V + beta(t, x) V_n = gamma(t, x)`, where `V_n` is the
  derivative with respect to the exterior normal to the boundary.
  Each callable receives the current time `t` and the `coord_grid` at the
  current time, and should return a tuple of `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma`.
  Each can be a number, a zero-rank `Tensor` or a `Tensor` whose shape is
  the grid shape with the corresponding dimension removed.
  For example, for a two-dimensional grid of shape `(b, ny, nx)`, where
  `b` is the batch size, `boundary_conditions[0][i]` with `i = 0, 1`
  should return a tuple of either numbers, zero-rank tensors or tensors of
  shape `(b, nx)`. Similarly for `boundary_conditions[1][i]`, except the
  tensor shape should be `(b, ny)`. `alpha` and `beta` can also be `None`
  in case of Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, respectively.
  Default value: `None`. Unlike setting `None` to individual elements of
  `boundary_conditions`, setting the entire `boundary_conditions` object
  to `None` means Dirichlet conditions with zero value on all boundaries
  are applied.
* <b>`start_step_count`</b>: Scalar integer `Tensor`. Initial value for the number of
  time steps performed.
  Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).
* <b>`num_steps`</b>: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take
  when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the
  `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is
  `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the
  solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter
  above.
* <b>`time_step`</b>: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`
  argument must be supplied (but not both). The type of this argument may
  be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case
    `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The
    maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then
    the total number of steps taken is N = (t0 - t1) / dt rounded up to
    the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last
    step is of size `t0 - t1 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the
    current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and
    the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.
* <b>`values_transform_fn`</b>: An optional callable applied to transform the
  solution values at each time step. The callable is invoked after the
  time step has been performed. The callable should accept the time of the
  grid, the coordinate grid and the values grid and should return the
  values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: The dtype to use.
* <b>`name`</b>: The name to give to the ops.
  Default value: None which means `solve_backward` is used.
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Additional keyword args:
  (1) pde_solver_fn: Function to solve the PDE that accepts all the above
    arguments by name and returns the same tuple object as required below.
    Defaults to `tff.math.pde.fd_solvers.solve_backward`.


#### Returns:

A tuple object containing at least the following attributes:
  final_values_grid: A `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `values_grid`.
    Contains the final state of the values grid at time `end_time`.
  final_coord_grid: A list of `Tensor`s of the same specification as
    the input `coord_grid`. Final state of the coordinate grid at time
    `end_time`.
  step_count: The total step count (i.e. the sum of the `start_step_count`
    and the number of steps performed in this call.).
  final_time: The final time at which the evolution stopped. This value
    is given by `max(min(end_time, start_time), 0)`.


<h3 id="fd_solver_forward"><code>fd_solver_forward</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
fd_solver_forward(
    start_time, end_time, coord_grid, values_grid, one_step_fn=None,
    boundary_conditions=None, start_step_count=0, num_steps=None, time_step=None,
    values_transform_fn=None, dtype=None, name=None, **kwargs
)
```

Returns a solver for the Fokker Plank equation of this process.

The Fokker Plank equation (also known as the Kolmogorov Forward equation)
associated to this Ito process is given by:

```None
  V_t + Sum[(mu_i(t, x) V)_i, 1<=i<=n]
    - (1/2) Sum[ (D_{ij} V)_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] = 0
```

with the initial value condition $$V(0, x) = u(x)$$.

This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
time `t0` to time `t1 > t0` (i.e. forwards in time).
The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional
rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described
by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,
a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian
product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with
coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.

This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means
the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
(e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified
by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a
`Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th
axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:
`batch_shape + payoff_shape + [d1, d2, ... dn]` where `batch_shape` is the
batch of processes as in the underlying `drift_fn` and `volatility_fn` and
`payoff_shape` are the equations to be solved for each batch element.

The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
(sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
time steps is equal to the total time step `t1 - t0`. If a uniform time
step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of
steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the
`time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need
discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument
may not be applicable to some implementations.

The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used
methods, see functions in <a href="../../../tf_quant_finance/math/pde/steppers.md"><code>math.pde.steppers</code></a> module.

The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above
equation are described in the Args section below.

For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see
<a href="../../../tf_quant_finance/models/GenericItoProcess.md#fd_solver_forward"><code>models.GenericItoProcess.fd_solver_forward</code></a>.

#### Args:


* <b>`start_time`</b>: Real positive scalar `Tensor`. The start time of the grid.
  Corresponds to time `t0` above.
* <b>`end_time`</b>: Real scalar `Tensor` smaller than the `start_time` and greater
  than zero. The time to step back to. Corresponds to time `t1` above.
* <b>`coord_grid`</b>: List of `n` rank 1 real `Tensor`s. `n` is the dimension of the
  domain. The i-th `Tensor` has shape, `[d_i]` where `d_i` is the size of
  the grid along axis `i`. The coordinates of the grid points. Corresponds
  to the spatial grid `G` above.
* <b>`values_grid`</b>: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
  `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape
  of the `Tensor` must broadcast with
  `batch_shape + payoff_shape + [d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. `batch_shape`
  represents the batch of the processes as in the underlying `drift_fn`
  and `volatility_fn`. `payoff_shape` specifies equations to be solved for
  each batch element (with potentially different boundary/final conditions
  and for various coordinate grids). When the batch dimensions
  `batch_shape` or `payoff_shape` are present, the shape of values_grid`
  must be at least `batch_shape + payoff_shape + dim * [1]`.
* <b>`one_step_fn`</b>: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following
  arguments by keyword:
    1. 'time': Current time
    2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time
      evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.
    3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.
    4. 'values_grid': The values grid.
    5. 'quadratic_coeff': A callable returning the quadratic coefficients
      of the PDE (i.e. `(1/2)D_{ij}(t, x)` above). The callable accepts
      the time and  coordinate grid as keyword arguments and returns a
      `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts with `[dim, dim]`.
    6. 'linear_coeff': A callable returning the linear coefficients of the
      PDE (i.e. `mu_i(t, x)` above). Accepts time and coordinate grid as
      keyword arguments and returns a `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts
      with `[dim]`.
    7. 'constant_coeff': A callable returning the coefficient of the
      linear homogeneous term (i.e. `r(t,x)` above). Same spec as above.
      The `one_step_fn` callable returns a 2-tuple containing the next
      coordinate grid, next values grid.
* <b>`boundary_conditions`</b>: The boundary conditions. Only rectangular boundary
  conditions are supported. A list of tuples of size `n` (space dimension
  of the PDE). The elements of the Tuple can be either a Python Callable
  or `None` representing the boundary conditions at the minimum and
  maximum values of the spatial variable indexed by the position in the
  list. E.g., for `n=2`, the length of `boundary_conditions` should be 2,
  `boundary_conditions[0][0]` describes the boundary `(y_min, x)`, and
  `boundary_conditions[1][0]`- the boundary `(y, x_min)`. `None` values
  mean that the second order terms for that dimension on the boundary are
  assumed to be zero, i.e., if `boundary_conditions[k][0]` is `None`,
  'dV/dt + Sum[a_ij d2(A_ij V)/dx_i dx_j, 1 <= i, j <= n, i!=k+1, j!=k+1]
     + Sum[b_i d(B_i V)/dx_i, 1 <= i <= n] + c V = 0.'
  For not `None` values, the boundary conditions are accepted in the form
  `alpha(t, x) V + beta(t, x) V_n = gamma(t, x)`, where `V_n` is the
  derivative with respect to the exterior normal to the boundary.
  Each callable receives the current time `t` and the `coord_grid` at the
  current time, and should return a tuple of `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma`.
  Each can be a number, a zero-rank `Tensor` or a `Tensor` whose shape is
  the grid shape with the corresponding dimension removed.
  For example, for a two-dimensional grid of shape `(b, ny, nx)`, where
  `b` is the batch size, `boundary_conditions[0][i]` with `i = 0, 1`
  should return a tuple of either numbers, zero-rank tensors or tensors of
  shape `(b, nx)`. Similarly for `boundary_conditions[1][i]`, except the
  tensor shape should be `(b, ny)`. `alpha` and `beta` can also be `None`
  in case of Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, respectively.
  Default value: `None`. Unlike setting `None` to individual elements of
  `boundary_conditions`, setting the entire `boundary_conditions` object
  to `None` means Dirichlet conditions with zero value on all boundaries
  are applied.
* <b>`start_step_count`</b>: Scalar integer `Tensor`. Initial value for the number of
  time steps performed.
  Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).
* <b>`num_steps`</b>: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take
  when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the
  `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is
  `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the
  solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter
  above.
* <b>`time_step`</b>: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`
  argument must be supplied (but not both). The type of this argument may
  be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case
    `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The
    maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then
    the total number of steps taken is N = (t1 - t0) / dt rounded up to
    the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last
    step is of size `t1 - t0 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the
    current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and
    the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.
* <b>`values_transform_fn`</b>: An optional callable applied to transform the
  solution values at each time step. The callable is invoked after the
  time step has been performed. The callable should accept the time of the
  grid, the coordinate grid and the values grid and should return the
  values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: The dtype to use.
* <b>`name`</b>: The name to give to the ops.
  Default value: None which means `solve_forward` is used.
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Additional keyword args:
  (1) pde_solver_fn: Function to solve the PDE that accepts all the above
    arguments by name and returns the same tuple object as required below.
    Defaults to `tff.math.pde.fd_solvers.solve_forward`.


#### Returns:

A tuple object containing at least the following attributes:
  final_values_grid: A `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `values_grid`.
    Contains the final state of the values grid at time `end_time`.
  final_coord_grid: A list of `Tensor`s of the same specification as
    the input `coord_grid`. Final state of the coordinate grid at time
    `end_time`.
  step_count: The total step count (i.e. the sum of the `start_step_count`
    and the number of steps performed in this call.).
  final_time: The final time at which the evolution stopped. This value
    is given by `max(min(end_time, start_time), 0)`.

```python
volatility_fn()
```

Python callable calculating the instantaneous volatility.

The callable should accept two real `Tensor` arguments of the same dtype and
shape `times_shape`. The first argument is the scalar time t, the second
argument is the value of Ito process X - `Tensor` of shape
`batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim]`, where `batch_shape` represents a batch
of models and `sample_shape` represents samples for each of the models. The
result is value of volatility S_{ij}(t, X). The return value of the callable
is a real `Tensor` of the same dtype as the input arguments and of shape
`batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim, dim]`. For example, `sample_shape` can
stand for `[num_samples]` for Monte Carlo sampling, or
`[num_grid_points_1, ..., num_grid_points_dim]` for Finite Difference
solvers.

#### Returns:

The instantaneous volatility callable.
