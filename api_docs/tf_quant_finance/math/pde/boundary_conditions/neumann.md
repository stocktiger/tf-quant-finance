Wrapper for Neumann boundary condition to be used in PDE solvers.

```python
tf_quant_finance.math.pde.boundary_conditions.neumann(
    boundary_normal_derivative_fn
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Example: the normal boundary derivative is 1 on both boundaries (i.e.
`dV/dx = 1` on upper boundary, `dV/dx = -1` on lower boundary).

```python
def lower_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
  return 1

def upper_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
  return 1

solver = fd_solvers.step_back(...,
    boundary_conditions = [(neumann(lower_boundary_fn),
                            neumann(upper_boundary_fn))],
    ...)
```

Also can be used as a decorator:

```python
@neumann
def lower_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
  return 1

@neumann
def upper_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
  return 1

solver = fd_solvers.solve_forward(...,
    boundary_conditions = [(lower_boundary_fn, upper_boundary_fn)],
    ...)
```

#### Args:


* <b>`boundary_normal_derivative_fn`</b>: Callable returning the values of the
  derivative with respect to the exterior normal to the boundary at the
  given time.
  Accepts two arguments - the moment of time and the current coordinate
  grid.
  Returns a number, a zero-rank Tensor or a Tensor of shape
  `batch_shape + grid_shape'`, where `grid_shape'` is grid_shape excluding
  the axis orthogonal to the boundary. For example, in 3D the value grid
  shape is `batch_shape + (z_size, y_size, x_size)`, and the boundary
  tensors on the planes `y = y_min` and `y = y_max` should be either scalars
  or have shape `batch_shape + (z_size, x_size)`. In 1D case this reduces
  to just `batch_shape`.


#### Returns:

Callable suitable for PDE solvers.
