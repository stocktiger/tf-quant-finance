Interface for specifying Ito processes.

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

  Interface for defining stochastic process defined by the Ito SDE:

  ```None
    dX_i = a_i(t, X) dt + Sum(S_{ij}(t, X) dW_j for 1 <= j <= n), 1 <= i <= n
  ```

The vector coefficient `a_i` is referred to as the drift of the process and
the matrix `S_{ij}` as the volatility of the process. For the process to be
well defined, these coefficients need to satisfy certain technical conditions
which may be found in Ref. [1]. The vector `dW_j` represents independent
Brownian increments.

For a simple and instructive example of the implementation of this interface,
see <a href="../../tf_quant_finance/models/GenericItoProcess.md"><code>models.GenericItoProcess</code></a>.

## Methods

<h3 id="dim"><code>dim</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
dim()
```

The dimension of the process. A positive python integer.


<h3 id="drift_fn"><code>drift_fn</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
drift_fn()
```

Python callable calculating instantaneous drift.

The callable should accept two real `Tensor` arguments of the same dtype.
The first argument is the scalar time t, the second argument is the value of
Ito process X - `Tensor` of shape `batch_shape + [dim]`. Here `batch_shape`
is an arbitrary shape. The result is the  value of drift a(t, X). The return
value of the callable is a real `Tensor` of the same dtype as the input
arguments and of shape `batch_shape + [dim]`.

#### Returns:

The instantaneous drift rate callable.


<h3 id="dtype"><code>dtype</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
dtype()
```

The data type of process realizations.


<h3 id="fd_solver_backward"><code>fd_solver_backward</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
fd_solver_backward(
    start_time, end_time, coord_grid, values_grid, discounting=None,
    one_step_fn=None, boundary_conditions=None, start_step_count=0, num_steps=None,
    time_step=None, values_transform_fn=None, dtype=None, **kwargs
)
```

Returns a solver for Feynman-Kac PDE associated to the process.

This method applies a finite difference method to solve the final value
problem as it appears in the Feynman-Kac formula associated to this Ito
process. The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov
equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion
of a discounting function.

For more details of the Feynman-Kac theorem see [1]. The PDE solved by this
method is:

```None
  V_t + Sum[mu_i(t, x) V_i, 1<=i<=n] +
    (1/2) Sum[ D_{ij} V_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] - r(t, x) V = 0
```

In the above, `V_t` is the derivative of `V` with respect to `t`,
`V_i` is the partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `V_{ij}` the
(mixed) partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `x_j`. `mu_i` is the
drift of this process and `D_{ij}` are the components of the diffusion
tensor:

```None
  D_{ij}(t,x) = (Sigma(t,x) . Transpose[Sigma(t,x)])_{ij}
```

This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).
The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional
rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described
by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,
a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian
product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with
coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.

This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means
the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
(e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified
by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a
`Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th
axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:
[K, d1, d2, ... dn] where `K` is the batch size. This method only requires
that the input parameter `values_grid` be broadcastable with shape
[K, d1, ... dn].

The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
(sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time
step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of
steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the
`time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need
discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument
may not be applicable to some implementations.

The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used
methods, see functions in <a href="../../tf_quant_finance/math/pde/steppers.md"><code>math.pde.steppers</code></a> module.

The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above
equation are described in the Args section below.

For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see
<a href="../../tf_quant_finance/models/GenericItoProcess.md#fd_solver_backward"><code>models.GenericItoProcess.fd_solver_backward</code></a>.

TODO(b/142309558): Complete documentation.

#### Args:


* <b>`start_time`</b>: Real positive scalar `Tensor`. The start time of the grid.
  Corresponds to time `t0` above.
* <b>`end_time`</b>: Real scalar `Tensor` smaller than the `start_time` and greater
  than zero. The time to step back to. Corresponds to time `t1` above.
* <b>`coord_grid`</b>: List of `n` rank 1 real `Tensor`s. `n` is the dimension of the
  domain. The i-th `Tensor` has shape, `[d_i]` where `d_i` is the size of
  the grid along axis `i`. The coordinates of the grid points. Corresponds
  to the spatial grid `G` above.
* <b>`values_grid`</b>: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
  `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape
  of the `Tensor` must broadcast with `[K, d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. The first
  axis of size `K` is the values batch dimension and allows multiple
  functions (with potentially different boundary/final conditions) to be
  stepped back simultaneously.
* <b>`discounting`</b>: Callable corresponding to `r(t,x)` above. If not supplied,
  zero discounting is assumed.
* <b>`one_step_fn`</b>: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following
  arguments by keyword:
    1. 'time': Current time
    2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time
      evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.
    3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.
    4. 'values_grid': The values grid.
    5. 'boundary_conditions': The boundary conditions.
    6. 'quadratic_coeff': A callable returning the quadratic coefficients
      of the PDE (i.e. `(1/2)D_{ij}(t, x)` above). The callable accepts
      the time and  coordinate grid as keyword arguments and returns a
      `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts with `[dim, dim]`.
    7. 'linear_coeff': A callable returning the linear coefficients of the
      PDE (i.e. `mu_i(t, x)` above). Accepts time and coordinate grid as
      keyword arguments and returns a `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts
      with `[dim]`.
    8. 'constant_coeff': A callable returning the coefficient of the
      linear homogenous term (i.e. `r(t,x)` above). Same spec as above.
      The `one_step_fn` callable returns a 2-tuple containing the next
      coordinate grid, next values grid.
* <b>`boundary_conditions`</b>: A list of size `dim` containing boundary conditions.
  The i'th element of the list is a 2-tuple containing the lower and upper
  boundary condition for the boundary along the i`th axis.
* <b>`start_step_count`</b>: Scalar integer `Tensor`. Initial value for the number of
  time steps performed.
  Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).
* <b>`num_steps`</b>: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take
  when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the
  `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is
  `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the
  solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter
  above.
* <b>`time_step`</b>: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`
  argument must be supplied (but not both). The type of this argument may
  be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case
    `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The
    maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then
    the total number of steps taken is N = (t0 - t1) / dt rounded up to
    the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last
    step is of size `t0 - t1 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the
    current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and
    the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.
* <b>`values_transform_fn`</b>: An optional callable applied to transform the
  solution values at each time step. The callable is invoked after the
  time step has been performed. The callable should accept the time of the
  grid, the coordinate grid and the values grid and should return the
  values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: The dtype to use.
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Any other keyword args needed by an implementation.

fd_solver_forward(
    start_time, end_time, coord_grid, values_grid, one_step_fn=None,
    boundary_conditions=None, start_step_count=0, num_steps=None, time_step=None,
    values_transform_fn=None, dtype=None, **kwargs
)
```

Returns a solver for the Fokker Plank equation of this process.

The Fokker Plank equation (also known as the Kolmogorov Forward equation)
associated to this Ito process is given by:

```None
  V_t + Sum[(mu_i(t, x) V)_i, 1<=i<=n]
    - (1/2) Sum[ (D_{ij} V)_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] = 0
```

with the initial value condition $$V(0, x) = u(x)$$.

This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
time `t0` to time `t1 > t0` (i.e. forwards in time).
The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional
rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described
by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,
a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian
product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with
coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.

Batching of solutions is supported. In this context, batching means
the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
(e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified
by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a
`Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th
axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:
[K, d1, d2, ... dn] where `K` is the batch size. This method only requires
that the input parameter `values_grid` be broadcastable with shape
[K, d1, ... dn].

The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
(sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
time steps is equal to the total time step `t1 - t0`. If a uniform time
