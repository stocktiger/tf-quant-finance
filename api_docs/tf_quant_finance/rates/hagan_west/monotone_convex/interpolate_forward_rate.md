Interpolates instantaneous forward rate to supplied times .

```python
tf_quant_finance.rates.hagan_west.monotone_convex.interpolate_forward_rate(
    interpolation_times, reference_times, yields=None, discrete_forwards=None,
    validate_args=False, dtype=None, name=None
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

  Applies the Hagan West procedure to interpolate either a zero coupon yield
  curve or a discrete forward curve to a given set of times to compute
  the instantaneous forward rate for those times.

  A zero coupon yield curve is specified by a set
  of times and the yields on zero coupon bonds expiring at those
  times. A discrete forward rate curve specifies the interest rate that
  applies between two times in the future as seen from the current time.
  The relation between the two sets of curve is as follows. Suppose the
  yields on zero coupon bonds expiring at times `[t_1, ..., t_n]` are
  `[r_1, ..., r_n]`, then the forward rate between time `[t_i, t_{i+1}]` is
  denoted `f(0; t_i, t_{i+1})` and given by

  ```None
    f(0; t_i, t_{i+1}) = (r_{i+1} t_{i+1} - r_i t_i) / (t_{i+1} - t_i)
  ```
  This function uses the Hagan West algorithm to perform the interpolation.
  This scheme interpolates on the forward curve. If `yields` are specified
  instead of `discrete_forwards` then they are first converted to the
  discrete forwards before interpolation.
  For more details on the interpolation procedure, see Ref. [1].

#### Example

```python
  dtype = np.float64
  # Market data.
  reference_times = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, 5.0], dtype=dtype)
  yields = np.array([2.75, 4.0, 4.75, 5.0, 4.75], dtype=dtype) / 100

  # Times for which the interpolated values are required.
  interpolation_times = np.array([0.3, 1.3, 2.1, 4.5], dtype=dtype)
  interpolated_forwards = interpolate_forward_rates(
      interpolation_times,
      reference_times=reference_times,
      yields=yields)

  # Produces: [0.0229375, 0.05010625, 0.0609, 0.03625].
```

#### Args:


* <b>`interpolation_times`</b>: Non-negative rank 1 `Tensor` of any size. The times for
  which the interpolation has to be performed.
* <b>`reference_times`</b>: Strictly positive rank 1 `Tensor` of real dtype containing
  increasing values. The expiry times of the underlying zero coupon bonds.
* <b>`yields`</b>: Optional rank 1 `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as
  `reference_times`, if supplied. The yield rate of zero coupon bonds
  expiring at the corresponding time in the `reference_times`. Either this
  argument or the `discrete_forwards` must be supplied (but not both).
  Default value: None.
* <b>`discrete_forwards`</b>: Optional rank 1 `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as
  `reference_times`, if supplied. The `i`th component of the `Tensor` is the
  forward rate that applies between `reference_times[i-1]` and
  `reference_times[i]` for `i>0` and between time `0` and
  `reference_times[0]` for `i=0`. Either this argument or the `yields` must
  be specified (but not both).
  Default value: None.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python bool. If true, adds control dependencies to check that
  the `times` are bounded by the `reference_times`.
  Default value: False
* <b>`dtype`</b>: `tf.Dtype` to use when converting arguments to `Tensor`s. If not
  supplied, the default Tensorflow conversion will take place. Note that
  this argument does not do any casting.
  Default value: None.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.
  Default value: None which is mapped to the default name
    'interpolate_forward_rate'.


#### Returns:


* <b>`interpolated_forwards`</b>: Rank 1 `Tensor` of the same size and dtype as the
  `interpolation_times`. The interpolated instantaneous forwards at the
  `interpolation_times`.


#### Raises:

ValueError if neither `yields` nor `discrete_forwards` are specified or if
both are specified.
